the bigger a company is, the less is known about the individual employees. a lot of skills remain hidden and problems that could be solved internally are solved by external people. this causes unnecessary costs. with the skills app i make the invisible skills visible.

This app was developed as my capstone project during the final four weeks of the neuefische Web Development Bootcamp in June/July 2021.
